## SweetLime (beta) for SublimeText3
SweetLime is ST3 plugin to develop Apigee Proxies. With built in template support for policies, steps and flows, SweetLime helps proxy developers build proxies with ease.

##Installing
###Package Control (Not yet submitted - for now use the other two options)
The easiest way to install this is with Package Control.
If you just went and installed [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you probably need to restart Sublime Text 3 before doing this next bit.
Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
Select **Apigee SweetLime** when the list appears.
Package Control will automatically keep SweetLime up to date with the latest version.

###Without Git: 
Download the latest source from GitHub and copy the SweetLime folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

###With Git: 
Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

OSX
> `git clone git@github.com:apigee/Sweetlime.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/ApigeeSweetLime'

Windows
> coming soon (testing underway)

##Using
SweetLime is very intuitive. Bring up the command pallette (OS X: command + shift + p) and type Apigee to see the list of all possible options Sweetlime provides.
