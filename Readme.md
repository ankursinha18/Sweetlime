### SWEETLIME beta
## SweetLime (beta) for SublimeText3
Sweetlime is ST3 plugin to develop Apigee Proxies. With built in template support for policies, steps and flows, SweetLime helps proxy developers build proxies with ease.

##Installing
As of now, Sweetlime can only be obtained from the git repo. SweetLime will go onto package control once its out of beta.

#Without Git: 
Download the latest source from GitHub and copy the SublimeLinter folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

#With Git: 
Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:
